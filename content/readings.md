I'm not a huge reader anymore (high school was a different story), though I try to read a book every now and then. Here are some of the books/audiobooks I've read recently and a short description with the year I read it. I hope to keep updating this list as time goes on with whatever books I read.

## Books I have read

### **Skunkworks** by Ben Rich and Leo Janos (2019)

An amazing account of many of the behind-the-scenes shenanigans at Skunkworks, the secretive R&D department at Lockheed Martin that's responsible for many of the iconic Cold War era spy planes such as the U-2 spy plane (Francis Gary Powers anyone?) and the SR-71 Blackbird. Not gripping in the sense of a normal thriller book, but you definitely want to stick around as Ben explains some of the engineering roadblocks and subsequent innovations that kept American spy planes one step ahead of the Soviets. The book also offers a glimpse into 'office politics' that had to be dealt with when working with the US government. Overall an amazing book with a style that will keep you pondering about the stories long after you put the book down. Highly recommend.

### **#TheStormPilot** by Santiago Borgia (2019)

This is kind of cheating as it's more of a picture book, but it is still definitely worth mentioning. This book is a collection of often breathtaking pictures of forming storms or city skylines/lights from the air the author has taken over the years as a commercial pilot. There are also explanations of the different cloud formations, storms, dangers, and various phenomena pictured in the book. It's like attending an art gallery with the added benefits of the explanations and the fact that you haven't moved from your couch. He also has tons of pictures on his Instagram @SantiagoBorgia for anyone who is interested in the sorts of images in the book.

### **The 50th Law** by Robert Greene

**The 50th Law** analyses the rapper 50 Cent's rise to fame and some of the causes of this meteoric rise. In a similar fashion as Greene's other book **The 48 Laws of Power**, this book discusses many of the personality traits that 50 Cent displays such as tenacity, fearlessness, etc. and brings up reasons why they helped him rise above the rest. I personally did not find the writing style of **The 50th Law** to be as good as that of **The 48 Laws of Power** - which is also by Greene - though I would still give it a mediocre recommendation. 

### **The Storm Before the Storm: The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic** by Mike Duncan (2018)

Julius Caesar is almost as much of a household name as Muhammad Ali, even though he lived almost 2000 years before. According to Caesar himself, *"I came, I saw, I conquered"* (Veni, vidi, vici). Though he is infamous for bringing the demise of the Roman Republic and installing himself as an emperor in all but name, he did not operate in a vacuum nor were his actions completely unheard of. If the metaphor about *standing on the shoulders of giants* is applied, **The Storm Before the Storm** is a tale about these giants. The men who - just a couple generations before - created the precedents that Caesar followed and exploited, men like Marius, Sulla, and the Gracchi brothers. Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in ancient Rome, specifically the fall of the Roman Republic.

### **The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy** by Thomas J. Stanley (2018)

You could probably sum up this entire book by Ben Franklin's saying: *"A penny saved is a penny earned"*. The authors interviewed many people about their spending habits and financial situations and wrote this book about their findings. In interview after interview, the author finds that income isn't necessarily always positively correlated with accumulation of wealth. Spending habits, especially compared to total income is a much more accurate predictor when trying to figure out whether a person is a UAW (Under Accumulator of Wealth) or a PAW (Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth). Read this book to learn about this one weird trick our consumer economy doesn't want you to know! The writing style is a bit dated, though the message is as applicable now as it was 20 years ago. Well worth the read.

### **The Art of War** by Sun Tzu (2017)

I can't say I have ever had to directly apply his warfare strategies and stratagems in my career as a software engineer, but they are occasionally useful when playing Starcraft I guess. An interesting and short read - the book is essentially as massive bullet point list.

### **The 48 Laws of Power** by Robert Greene (Audible) (2017)
### **The Prince** by Machiavelli (audible) (2017)
### **All Quiet on the Western Front** by Erich Maria Remarque (Audible) (2016)
### **The Imperial Cruise** by James Bradley (2015)
### **Flags of our Fathers** by James Bradley (2015)
