 Thanks for stopping by! I'm currently doing an Online Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech while based in Connecticut. I spent three years after my undergrad working as a software engineer at Morgan Stanley (2016-2019), and recently left to focus on my Masters. 
 
 I'm aiming to have a general, not-necessarily-always-technical blog to talk about whatever is holding my attention captive at the moment - mainly programming, baking, the outdoors, and 3d printing. Feel free to reach out to me on any of those topics or to talk about any other interesting tidbit of knowledge!

 Here are my various handles across the intertubes:
