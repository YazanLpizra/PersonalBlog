      <description>Thanks for stopping by! I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing an Online Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech while based in Connecticut. I spent three years after my undergrad working as a software engineer at Morgan Stanley (2016-2019), and recently left to focus on my Masters.
I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to have a general, not-necessarily-always-technical blog to talk about whatever is holding my attention captive at the moment - mainly programming, baking, the outdoors, and 3d printing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge reader anymore (high school was a different story), though I try to read a book every now and then.
